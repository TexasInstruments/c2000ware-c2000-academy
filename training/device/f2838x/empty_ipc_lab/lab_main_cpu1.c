//! <h1> Lab Solution on Inter Processor Communication (CPU1) </h1>
//!
//! The objective of this lab exercise is to demonstrate and become familiar
//! with the operation of the IPC module. We will be using the basic IPC
//! features to send data in both directions between CPU1 and CPU2. As in
//! the previous lab exercise, PWM2 will be configured to provide a 50 kHz
//! SOC signal to ADC-A. An End-of-Conversion ISR on CPU1 will read each
//! result and write it into a data register in the IPC. An IPC interrupt
//! will then be triggered on CPU2 which fetches this data and stores it in
//! a circular buffer. The same ISR grabs a data point from a sine table and
//! loads it into a different IPC register for transmission to CPU1. This
//! triggers an interrupt on CPU1 to fetch the sine data and write it into
//! DAC-B. The DAC-B output is connected by a jumper wire to the ADCINA0 pin.
//! If the program runs as expected the sine table and ADC results buffer on
//! CPU2 should contain very similar data.
//!
//! \b External \b Connections \n
//!  - Jumper cable between ADCINA0 pin to the DACB pin
//!
//! \b Watch \b Variables \n
//!  - None.
